      "Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, particularly in natural language processing. It involves understanding how to frame questions or statements to elicit the most accurate and relevant responses from AI systems. This skill is crucial for maximizing the utility of AI tools, as the quality of the output is often directly related to the clarity and specificity of the input. For example, a well-structured prompt can lead to more insightful answers, while vague prompts may yield less useful information.\n",

      "Model fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained machine learning model and adjusting its parameters on a new, often smaller dataset to improve its performance on a specific task. This technique leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training phase, allowing it to adapt to new data with less computational cost and time. Fine-tuning is particularly useful in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, where large models can be trained on vast datasets and then refined for specific applications, such as sentiment analysis or image classification.\n",

      "Custom model training involves the process of developing machine learning models tailored to specific datasets and requirements. This skill encompasses selecting appropriate algorithms, preprocessing data, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance. By training models on custom datasets, practitioners can achieve better accuracy and relevance for specific tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or predictive analytics. For instance, a custom model can be trained to classify medical images or to analyze sentiment in customer reviews, providing insights that generic models may not capture.\n",
